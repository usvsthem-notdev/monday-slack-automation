# Configuration Fix: Unified Server Entry Point

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Issue**: Service was using legacy entry points instead of unified server  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Problem Identified

The service had configuration mismatches where different files were pointing to legacy server implementations:

1. **app.js** was pointing to `server.js` (legacy Slack commands only)
2. **render.yaml** was pointing to `automation.js` (legacy daily automation only)
3. **Actual Render service** was using `app.js` which loaded the wrong server

## Solution Applied

### Files Updated

#### 1. `src/app.js`
**Before:**
```javascript
require('./server.js');  // Legacy - Slack commands only
```

**After:**
```javascript
require('./unified-server.js');  // v6.0 - All features unified
```

#### 2. `render.yaml`
**Before:**
```yaml
startCommand: node src/automation.js  # Legacy - Daily automation only
```

**After:**
```yaml
startCommand: node src/unified-server.js  # v6.0 - All features unified
```

**Additional Changes:**
- Changed build command from `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to `npm install` (matches package.json)
- Updated PORT from 1000 to 3000 (matches unified-server.js default)
- Added TEST_MODE environment variable
- Added v6.0 architecture notes

## Architecture Confirmation

Both features now run on the **same unified server**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Unified Server (v6.0)              │
│  src/unified-server.js              │
│                                     │
│  ✅ /create-task command            │
│  ✅ Daily automation                │
│  ✅ Webhook handler                 │
│  ✅ Interactive components          │
│  ✅ Shared async queue              │
│  ✅ Single Express server           │
│  ✅ Single port (3000)              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Deployment

Since auto-deploy is enabled on the main branch, Render will automatically:
1. ✅ Detect the new commits
2. ✅ Build the service with `npm install`
3. ✅ Start with `node src/app.js` (which now loads unified-server.js)
4. ✅ Run health checks on `/health` endpoint

## Verification Steps

Once deployed, verify the fix with:

```bash
# Check service is running unified server
curl https://monday-slack-automation.onrender.com/

# Should return:
{
  "message": "Monday.com → Slack Unified Automation Server",
  "version": "6.0.0-unified",
  "status": "running",
  "features": [
    "✅ Async request processing",
    "✅ Interactive Slack commands",
    "✅ Daily task automation",
    "✅ Real-time webhooks",
    "✅ Task action buttons",
    "✅ Modal interactions",
    "✅ Background job queue"
  ]
}

# Check health
curl https://monday-slack-automation.onrender.com/health

# Check queue status
curl https://monday-slack-automation.onrender.com/metrics
```

## Benefits

- ✅ Single server handles both `/create-task` and daily automation
- ✅ Shared resources and configuration
- ✅ Consistent logging and metrics
- ✅ Easier to maintain and debug
- ✅ No more confusion about which server is running
- ✅ Proper async queue for all operations

## Commits

1. **968c505** - Fix: Update app.js to use unified-server.js instead of legacy server.js
2. **f1fd92f** - Fix: Update render.yaml to use unified-server.js and correct configuration

## Next Steps

- Monitor deployment logs in Render dashboard
- Test `/create-task` command in Slack
- Test daily automation trigger: `POST /trigger`
- Verify webhook notifications still work

---

**Result**: Both the `/create-tasks` command and the daily automation now run on the same unified server instance. 🎉
