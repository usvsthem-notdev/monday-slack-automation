# Repository Revert to Commit 5952e4b

This commit reverts the repository to the state it was at commit `5952e4b40c8fde3b8700890f97faa1173a4f9251` with the message "Use messageFormatter for interactive buttons in daily tasks".

## Reverted Changes

All changes made after commit 5952e4b have been reverted, including:

1. **Button Handler Implementations** (commits d8269135 through 672313ab)
   - Complete, Update, +1 Day, and View buttons
   - Button interaction handlers
   - Modal submission handlers

2. **Timeout and Acknowledgment Fixes** 
   - Ultra-fast ack patterns using process.nextTick
   - Button handler registrations before server start
   - Immediate acknowledgment patterns

3. **Handler Registration Changes**
   - Movement of handlers from server.js to automation.js
   - Registration timing optimizations
   - Handler consolidation efforts

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - ACK timing improvements
   - Handler response patterns
   - Error handling for button interactions

## Current State

The repository is now in the state where:
- Basic messageFormatter functionality for interactive buttons is preserved
- Complex button handling and timeout fixes are removed
- The codebase is simplified to the pre-button-implementation state
- All subsequent architectural changes have been rolled back

## Reason for Revert

This revert was requested to restore the codebase to a simpler, more stable state before the complex button interaction implementations were added.
