# GitHub Actions Fix - Error Resolution

## ‚ùå Problem Identified

You ran the **wrong workflow** which caused the error:
```
sync-tasks
Process completed with exit code 1.
No files were found with the provided path: logs/
```

## üîç Root Cause

There were **TWO workflows** in `.github/workflows/`:

1. ‚ùå **`monday-slack-sync.yml`** (OLD - BROKEN)
   - Tries to run `node src/automation.js` directly
   - Expects the app to run as a script, not a server
   - Missing required environment variables
   - Looking for non-existent `logs/` directory
   - **This was the OLD approach before we implemented scheduled triggers**

2. ‚úÖ **`daily-sync.yml`** (NEW - CORRECT)
   - Sends HTTP POST request to `/trigger` endpoint
   - Simple and reliable
   - No secrets needed in GitHub Actions
   - Works with our new server-based approach

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

**Disabled the old workflow** to prevent confusion:
- Old workflow now shows: "[DISABLED] Old Monday.com Sync - DO NOT USE"
- Will not run automatically (no schedule)
- If manually triggered, it exits with helpful error message
- Kept for reference only

## üéØ How to Test Correctly

### Use the CORRECT Workflow

**Go to:** https://github.com/usvsthem-notdev/monday-slack-automation/actions

**Look for:** `Daily Monday.com Task Sync` (NOT "Monday.com to Slack Task Sync")

**Steps:**
1. Click **"Daily Monday.com Task Sync"**
2. Click **"Run workflow"** button
3. Select branch: `main`
4. Click green **"Run workflow"**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes
6. ‚úÖ Check Slack for message!

## üìä How to Identify the Correct Workflow

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Workflow: "Daily Monday.com Task Sync"
```yaml
name: Daily Monday.com Task Sync

Steps:
  - Trigger Monday.com ‚Üí Slack Automation
  - Summary
  
What it does:
  - Sends POST to https://monday-slack-automation.onrender.com/trigger
  - Shows HTTP status code
  - Creates summary
```

### ‚ùå OLD/DISABLED Workflow: "[DISABLED] Old Monday.com Sync"
```yaml
name: [DISABLED] Old Monday.com Sync - DO NOT USE

Steps:
  - Workflow Disabled (exits with error)
  
What it does:
  - Shows error message
  - Tells you to use the correct workflow
  - Exits with code 1
```

## üîß Why the Old Workflow Failed

**The old workflow tried to:**
1. Checkout the repository
2. Install Node.js and dependencies
3. Run `node src/automation.js` directly

**Why it failed:**
- Our new `automation.js` starts a **web server**, it doesn't run and exit
- The server expects to stay running and respond to HTTP requests
- Running it directly causes it to hang (waiting for requests)
- Missing `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` environment variable
- No `logs/` directory exists

**Our new approach:**
- Server runs on Render 24/7
- GitHub Action just sends an HTTP request
- Much simpler and more reliable

## üìù Summary of Changes

| Aspect | Old Workflow (Broken) | New Workflow (Fixed) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Name** | Monday.com to Slack Task Sync | Daily Monday.com Task Sync |
| **Method** | Run Node.js script directly | HTTP POST to /trigger |
| **Secrets Needed** | MONDAY_API_KEY, SLACK_BOT_TOKEN | None (server has them) |
| **Complexity** | High (install deps, run script) | Low (one curl command) |
| **Status** | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚úÖ Active |

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Use the correct workflow:**
   - "Daily Monday.com Task Sync" 
   - NOT "[DISABLED] Old Monday.com Sync"

2. **Test it:**
   - Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI
   - OR wait for 9 AM EST Monday-Friday

3. **Verify:**
   - Check for success ‚úÖ in GitHub Actions
   - Check Slack for task message
   - Check Render logs if needed

## üö® Important Notes

- **Always use:** "Daily Monday.com Task Sync"
- **Never use:** "[DISABLED] Old Monday.com Sync - DO NOT USE"
- The disabled workflow is kept only for reference
- It will show an error if accidentally triggered
- This prevents confusion going forward

## ‚úÖ Test Again Now

The correct workflow is ready. Try it:

1. Go to: https://github.com/usvsthem-notdev/monday-slack-automation/actions
2. Find: **"Daily Monday.com Task Sync"**
3. Click: **"Run workflow"**
4. Wait for completion
5. Check Slack!

---

**Problem solved!** You were using the old broken workflow. Use "Daily Monday.com Task Sync" instead.
