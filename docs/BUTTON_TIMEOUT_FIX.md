# Button Timeout Fix - October 15, 2025

## Problem

Users were experiencing "operation_timeout" errors when clicking interactive buttons in Slack task messages. The buttons would show a timeout error instead of performing their intended actions (Complete, Update, Postpone, View).

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Split Server Architecture
The application had **two separate Slack Bolt app instances**:
- `automation.js` - The main entry point running on port 10000
- `server.js` - A separate file with button handlers, but not being used

### Issue #2: Missing Handler Registration
The button interaction handlers were defined in `server.js` but **never registered** with the Slack app instance in `automation.js` (the actual running server).

### Issue #3: Slack's 3-Second Timeout
When a user clicked a button:
1. Slack sent the interaction payload to the server
2. No handler was registered to respond (handlers were in unused `server.js`)
3. Slack waited 3 seconds for acknowledgment
4. Timeout occurred → "operation_timeout" error shown to user

## Solution Implemented

### Consolidated Architecture
All button handlers were moved from `server.js` into `automation.js`, creating a single source of truth for all Slack interactions.

### Handlers Now Registered

**Button Action Handler:**
```javascript
slackApp.action(/^task_action_.*/, async ({ action, ack, body, client }) => {
  // CRITICAL: Acknowledge immediately to prevent timeout
  await ack();
  
  // Then process the action...
});
```

**Modal Submission Handler:**
```javascript
slackApp.view(/^update_task_modal_.*/, async ({ ack, body, view, client }) => {
  await ack();
  
  // Then process the modal data...
});
```

### Four Button Actions Implemented

1. **✅ Complete** - Marks task as done in Monday.com
2. **📝 Update** - Opens modal to update status, due date, and add notes
3. **📅 +1 Day** - Postpones task by one day
4. **🔗 View** - Shows full task details (this is a URL button, no handler needed)

## Technical Details

### Immediate Acknowledgment Pattern
All interactive handlers follow this critical pattern:
```javascript
async ({ ack, ...rest }) => {
  await ack();  // MUST be first line
  // ... rest of logic
}
```

This ensures Slack receives acknowledgment within the 3-second window.

### Action ID Format
Buttons generate action IDs in this format:
```
task_action_{action}_{taskId}_{boardId}
```

Examples:
- `task_action_complete_123456_789012`
- `task_action_update_123456_789012`
- `task_action_postpone_123456_789012`

### Regex Pattern Matching
The handler uses regex to match all task action buttons:
```javascript
/^task_action_.*/
```

Then splits the action_id to extract:
- Action type (complete, update, postpone, view)
- Task ID
- Board ID

## Files Modified

### `src/automation.js`
- ✅ Added all button interaction handlers
- ✅ Added modal submission handler
- ✅ Added proper error handling with ephemeral messages
- ✅ Added metrics tracking for button clicks
- ✅ Added logging for all button interactions
- ✅ Updated version to 4.8.0

### No Changes Needed to:
- `src/messageFormatter.js` - Button creation logic was already correct
- `src/server.js` - Can now be deprecated or removed

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Each Button Action:**
   - Click "Complete" on a task
   - Click "Update" and modify status/date
   - Click "+1 Day" to postpone
   - Click "View" to see details

2. **Verify Response Time:**
   - All actions should respond within 1 second
   - No "operation_timeout" errors should occur

3. **Check Logging:**
   - Monitor logs for button click events
   - Verify metrics are being tracked

4. **Test Error Scenarios:**
   - Click postpone on task without due date
   - Click complete on task without status column
   - Verify graceful error handling

## Deployment Notes

### Automatic Deployment
- Changes committed to `main` branch
- Render will auto-deploy the updated `automation.js`
- No environment variable changes needed
- No manual intervention required

### Verification Steps
After deployment:
1. Check `/health` endpoint shows healthy status
2. Check `/metrics` endpoint shows `buttonClicks` metric
3. Test a button click in Slack
4. Verify no timeout errors occur

## Monitoring

### New Metrics Added
- `buttonClicks` - Total number of button interactions

### Log Entries to Watch
- `"Button clicked: {actionType}"` - Successful button click
- `"Task completed"` - Successful task completion
- `"Task updated via modal"` - Successful modal submission
- `"Error handling button click"` - Any button errors

## Additional Improvements

### Error Handling
All button handlers now have comprehensive error handling:
- Catches and logs all errors
- Sends ephemeral error messages to users
- Tracks errors in metrics

### User Feedback
All successful actions now provide immediate feedback:
- ✅ "Task marked as complete"
- 📅 "Task postponed to [date]"
- ✅ "Task updated successfully"

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for button functionality:
1. Add "Snooze" button with custom time selection
2. Add "Reassign" button to change task owner
3. Add "Priority" button to update task priority
4. Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
5. Add undo functionality for recent changes
